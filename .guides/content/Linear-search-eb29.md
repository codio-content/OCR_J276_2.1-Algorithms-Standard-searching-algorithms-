A linear search is sequential. This algorithm starts at the beginning of the list and moves through item by item until it finds the matching item or reaches the end of the list.

Here is the algorithm:

1. Start at the first item in the list.
1. Compare the list item with the search criterion.
1. If they are the same, then stop.
1. If they are not the same, then move to the next item.
1. Repeat steps 2, 3 and 4.
1. If the end of the list is reached, then stop.

This is a simple algorithm and does not involve any specialist techniques – just sequence, selection and iteration. It is an example of a ‘brute force’ algorithm – it just uses raw computing power.
