Using binary search it took 3 comparisons to find the search criterion.
If the linear search was used it would have taken 12 comparisons.

In general the binary search is more efficient that the linear search especially if there are a large number of items in the list but the list must first be sorted into order before it is carried out.
For small lists a linear search may be more efficient as the list does not have to be sorted.
